# An A to Z Alphabet Book for Child and Adult

The alphabet has never been so much fun for joint adult/child reading! For each alphabet letter there are 1 or 2 feature words, photographs, critical thinking questions for child and adult to talk about, a BIG WORD for kids who love big words, and additional explanations for the adult. For example, the letter F features the Arctic Fox, with pictures of her winter, spring, and summer fur, BIG WORDS Camouflage and Countercurrent Heat Exchanger (a blood vessel valve that keeps her body heat in her core during the winter!) and additional information about how the arctic fox survives in the bitter winter cold. This book can be used by children as young as 1 or as old as middle/high school as reference material for school papers. The index shows pages for 222 scientific vocabulary terms. Perfect gift for your children or grandchildren and for your childâ€™s school library.
